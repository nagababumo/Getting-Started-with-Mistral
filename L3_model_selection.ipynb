      "Sure, I'd be happy to explain this code to you. This is a Python function that finds two numbers in a list that add up to a given target. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Function Definition**: The function `twoSum(nums, target)` is defined with two parameters: `nums`, which is a list of numbers, and `target`, which is the sum we're trying to find in the list.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Initialize a Dictionary**: The first line inside the function, `seen = {}`, initializes an empty dictionary. This dictionary will be used to store the numbers in the list as keys and their indices as values as we iterate through the list.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Iterate Through the List**: The `for` loop, `for i, num in enumerate(nums):`, iterates through the list `nums` with the help of the `enumerate` function. The `enumerate` function allows us to access both the index (`i`) and the value (`num`) of each item in the list simultaneously.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Find the Complement**: For each number in the list, we calculate its complement with respect to the target using `complement = target - num`. The complement is the number that, when added to the current number, gives the target sum.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Check if Complement is in Dictionary**: We then check if this complement is in our `seen` dictionary using `if complement in seen:`. If it is, that means we've found two numbers in the list that add up to the target.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Return Indices**: If the complement is found in the dictionary, we return a list containing the indices of the complement and the current number using `return [seen[complement], i]`. The index of the complement is obtained from the dictionary with `seen[complement]`, and `i` is the index of the current number.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. **Add Number to Dictionary**: If the complement is not found in the dictionary, we add the current number and its index to the dictionary with `seen[num] = i`. This is so we can check in future iterations if we find a number that complements the current number.\n",
      "\n",
      "8. **Return Empty List**: If no two numbers in the list add up to the target, the function will return an empty list `[]` after the `for` loop has iterated through all numbers in the list.\n"
