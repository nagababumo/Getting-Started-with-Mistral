    "European AI champion Mistral AI unveiled new large language models and formed an alliance with Microsoft. \n",
    "\n",
    "What’s new: Mistral AI introduced two closed models, Mistral Large and Mistral Small (joining Mistral Medium, which debuted quietly late last year). Microsoft invested $16.3 million in the French startup, and it agreed to distribute Mistral Large on its Azure platform and let Mistral AI use Azure computing infrastructure. Mistral AI makes the new models available to try for free here and to use on its La Plateforme and via custom deployments.\n",
    "\n",
    "Model specs: The new models’ parameter counts, architectures, and training methods are undisclosed. Like the earlier, open source Mistral 7B and Mixtral 8x7B, they can process 32,000 tokens of input context. \n",
    "\n",
    "Mistral Large achieved 81.2 percent on the MMLU benchmark, outperforming Anthropic’s Claude 2, Google’s Gemini Pro, and Meta’s Llama 2 70B, though falling short of GPT-4. Mistral Small, which is optimized for latency and cost, achieved 72.2 percent on MMLU.\n",
    "Both models are fluent in French, German, Spanish, and Italian. They’re trained for function calling and JSON-format output.\n",
    "Microsoft’s investment in Mistral AI is significant but tiny compared to its $13 billion stake in OpenAI and Google and Amazon’s investments in Anthropic, which amount to $2 billion and $4 billion respectively.\n",
    "Mistral AI and Microsoft will collaborate to train bespoke models for customers including European governments.\n",
    "Behind the news: Mistral AI was founded in early 2023 by engineers from Google and Meta. The French government has touted the company as a home-grown competitor to U.S.-based leaders like OpenAI. France’s representatives in the European Commission argued on Mistral’s behalf to loosen the European Union’s AI Act oversight on powerful AI models. \n",
    "\n",
    "Yes, but: Mistral AI’s partnership with Microsoft has divided European lawmakers and regulators. The European Commission, which already was investigating Microsoft’s agreement with OpenAI for potential breaches of antitrust law, plans to investigate the new partnership as well. Members of President Emmanuel Macron’s Renaissance party criticized the deal’s potential to give a U.S. company access to European users’ data. However, other French lawmakers support the relationship.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why it matters: The partnership between Mistral AI and Microsoft gives the startup crucial processing power for training large models and greater access to potential customers around the world. It gives the tech giant greater access to the European market. And it gives Azure customers access to a high-performance model that’s tailored to Europe’s unique regulatory environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "We’re thinking: Mistral AI has made impressive progress in a short time, especially relative to the resources at its disposal as a startup. Its partnership with a leading hyperscaler is a sign of the tremendous processing and distribution power that remains concentrated in the large, U.S.-headquartered cloud companies.\n",

      "## Q: What is the significance of Mistral AI's new models in the AI landscape?\n",
      "A: Mistral AI's new models represent a significant development in the AI landscape, as they outperform several other models in the MMLU benchmark. However, they still fall short of GPT-4, indicating that there is still room for improvement. The fact that they are fluent in several European languages and trained for function calling and JSON-format output also sets them apart from other models.\n",
      "\n",
      "<The significance of Mistral AI's new models lies in their performance, language capabilities, and training methods, which make them competitive in the AI landscape.>\n",
      "\n",
      "## Q: What are the potential implications of the partnership between Mistral AI and Microsoft?\n",
      "A: The partnership between Mistral AI and Microsoft has several potential implications. For Mistral AI, it provides crucial processing power for training large models and greater access to potential customers around the world. For Microsoft, it gives greater access to the European market. For Azure customers, it provides access to a high-performance model tailored to Europe’s unique regulatory environment. However, the partnership has also sparked controversy among European lawmakers and regulators, with some criticizing potential data access for U.S. companies.\n",
      "\n",
      "<The partnership between Mistral AI and Microsoft has potential benefits for all parties involved, but it also raises concerns about data access and privacy.>\n",
      "\n",
      "## Q: How does the European Commission's investigation into Mistral AI's partnership with Microsoft impact the AI industry?\n",
      "A: The European Commission's investigation into Mistral AI's partnership with Microsoft could have significant implications for the AI industry. If the Commission finds that the partnership violates antitrust law, it could set a precedent for future investigations into similar partnerships. This could potentially limit the ability of large tech companies to invest in and collaborate with AI startups. On the other hand, if the Commission finds no issue with the partnership, it could pave the way for more such collaborations in the future.\n",
      "\n",
      "<The European Commission's investigation into Mistral AI's partnership with Microsoft could have far-reaching implications for the AI industry, potentially setting a precedent for future investigations and limiting collaborations between large tech companies and AI startups.>\n",

      "## Mistral AI Unveils New Large Language Models and Forms Alliance with Microsoft\n",
      "\n",
      "European AI champion Mistral AI has made significant strides with the introduction of two new large language models, Mistral Large and Mistral Small. These models, which join the previously introduced Mistral Medium, are now available for free trial and use on La Plateforme and via custom deployments.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mistral Large has achieved an impressive score of 81.2 percent on the MMLU benchmark, outperforming several other models, including Anthropic’s Claude 2, Google’s Gemini Pro, and Meta’s Llama 2 70B. However, it still falls short of GPT-4. Mistral Small, optimized for latency and cost, achieved 72.2 percent on the same benchmark. Both models are fluent in French, German, Spanish, and Italian, and are trained for function calling and JSON-format output.\n",
      "\n",
      "In a significant move, Microsoft has invested $16.3 million in Mistral AI and agreed to distribute Mistral Large on its Azure platform. Mistral AI will also use Azure computing infrastructure. This partnership gives Mistral AI crucial processing power for training large models and greater access to potential customers around the world. For Microsoft, it provides greater access to the European market. For Azure customers, it offers access to a high-performance model tailored to Europe’s unique regulatory environment.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, the partnership has sparked controversy among European lawmakers and regulators. The European Commission, which is already investigating Microsoft’s agreement with OpenAI for potential breaches of antitrust law, plans to investigate the new partnership as well. Some members of President Emmanuel Macron’s Renaissance party have criticized the deal’s potential to give a U.S. company access to European users’ data. However, other French lawmakers support the relationship.\n",
      "\n",
      "The partnership between Mistral AI and Microsoft underscores the tremendous processing and distribution power that remains concentrated in large, U.S.-headquartered cloud companies. It also highlights the growing importance of large language models in the AI landscape, particularly those that can process large input contexts and are fluent in multiple languages.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, the European Commission’s investigation into the partnership could have far-reaching implications for the AI industry. If the Commission finds that the partnership violates antitrust law, it could set a precedent for future investigations into similar partnerships, potentially limiting the ability of large tech companies to invest in and collaborate with AI startups. On the other hand, if the Commission finds no issue with the partnership, it could pave the way for more such collaborations in the future.\n",
      "\n",
      "In conclusion, Mistral AI’s new models and partnership with Microsoft represent significant developments in the AI landscape. However, they also raise important questions about data access, privacy, and antitrust law that will likely shape the future of the AI industry.\n"
